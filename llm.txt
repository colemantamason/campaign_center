Technical Context: I'm building an app using Dioxus v0.7 (Rust) and Tailwind v3. You can use context7 for the latest Dioxus documentation.

Guidelines for Dioxus/Rust:
- Always look at how I structure / style components in my app and keep the coding style consistent in your changes.
- Always look at the idiomatic styling and semantics of how I program in Rust/Dioxus and stick to those. Here's some examples:
    - Always create my props (and types) outside of the component so that I can share types across files.
    - Always set props as an Optional instead of setting a default value.
    - Always use .to_string() over String::from()/new() unless we need to set specific capacity (String::with_capacity()).
    - Always use Rust's exhaustive match over if/else when possible.
    - Always try to access stores and signals using .read() and .write() so that we work with references as much as possible.
    - Always try to avoid .unwrap() and instead use let-else where possible.
    - Always use i32 (unless impossible) when working with numbers.
- I NEVER want to use "eval" (JS) if possible. I'd always rather do it with wasm (using packages like gloo, web_sys, etc. when necessary).

Guidelines for CSS/Styling:
- Always use flexbox when positioning elements. Keep other CSS as simple as possible (no cutting edge CSS).
- I use lucide_dioxus in my app for icons. Always style my Lucide icons with only the class attribute using Tailwind (w-X, h-X, etc.).
